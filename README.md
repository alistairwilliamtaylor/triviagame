# History Trivia

## Introduction
This project is a good opportunity to improve my skills working with React. By sourcing the trivia questions from the Open Trivia DB API, I am able to focus on creating a reactive, smooth experience on the front end.

## Technologies Used

* React Hooks and Context API
* Axios API Requests
* Async Await Syntax
* CSS

## Interesting Features
At this stage, the app doesn't exist

## Future Code Improvements
Currently, the app runs entirely on the client side, so anyone using Google Chrome with the React Devtools plugin can just look at the button components to find out which answer is correct. This could be addressed by creating a server to interact with the Open Trivia API and my React App, meaning that this information would not be available on the client side.
